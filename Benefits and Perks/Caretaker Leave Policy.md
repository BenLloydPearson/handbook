# Caretaker Leave Policy

- Nylas offers a 100% paid caretaker/parental leave policy of up to 12 weeks per year (as measured backwards, on a rolling basis, from the date of the leave commences) for employees and absences that meet the requirements set forth in this policy.
- Leave may be taken for:
  - the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child
  - caring for an employee's spouse, domestic partner, child or parent with a serious health condition
  - the serious health condition of the employee
- The pay benefit during caretaker leave is coordinated with state disability and paid family leave benefits, in addition to any other wage substitution benefits for which the employee is eligible. Examples of how the benefit might work in a particular situation are included at the end of this policy.
- Upon return from a leave, employees will generally be reinstated to their original or a comparable position and salary, although taking a leave does not protect an employee from non-leave related employment actions, such as a layoff.
- Employees on leave will continue to be eligible to participate in company-sponsored benefits, including equity vesting and health insurance, to the fullest extent permitted by the governing plans and agreements.
- Caretaker leave, vacation time, and sick leave do not overlap and must be approved separately.
- Subject to manager approval, leave may be taken in non-consecutive weekly blocks (intermittent leave) but no shorter than two week increments.

## Requirements 
- Requests for leaves must be submitted in writing at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the leave, although additional notice is encouraged and appreciated, particularly for extended leaves. In unforeseen/emergency cases, notice of the need for leave should be given as soon as is practical.
- Requests for leave must be supported to medical certification or other documentation demonstrating the qualifying purpose for the leave; employees returning from a leave for their own serious health condition may be required to provide written release from their health provider indicating their ability to return to work.
- To be eligible for paid caretaker leave, the employee must have been employed with the company at least six months; employees not meeting this eligibility requirement may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for an absence that would otherwise qualify for leave under this policy.
- Employees are required to file paperwork with CA SDI.
- Leave taken in connection with the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child must be completed within one year of the birth or placement giving rise to the leave entitlement.

## Scenarios

#### Sick family member leave for four weeks
- An employee has a need to take care of a relative/parent/etc. and requests four weeks of leave
- The leave is immediate and sudden; the employee provides medical certification as soon as practical
- Nylas covers Week 1 @ 100% of salary during waiting period
- If approved, CA PFL covers @ (up to) 55% of salary and Nylas covers @ 45% (plus any shortfall) of salary for Weeks 2-4

#### Pregnancy disability/bonding leave for 12 weeks
- An employee is pregnant and requests leave of 12 weeks in connection with birth and bonding with the baby
- Medical certification supports leave starting four weeks before due date
- SDI benefits apply to pregnancy disability; PFL benefits to baby bonding
- Nylas covers Week 1 A 100% during waiting period
- If approved, your state leave program covers a certain percentage of your salary, and Nylas covers the remaining portion (plus any shortfall) of salary for Weeks 2-12

All of the above are example scenarios given real-world situations and assume that the requesting employee meets eligibility requirements, including applying and qualifying for state wage substitution benefits. If any complications or unplanned scenarios arise, the Head of HR has discretion about policy changes/approvals/exceptions/etc.
