# Office Perks

## Meals

Foodies welcome! In our SF office, we offer lunch five days a week via Forkable, which will let you pick your own meal each day with a budget of $12.50, and dinner can be expensed for anyone who wants to work at the office past 6 p.m. Please help us use our resources wisely and cancel your lunch delivery if you're not going to be in the office.

Employees based out of the Nylas New York Office will receive lunch 3 days a week via Forkable, and a $12.50 a day stipend for lunch applied directly to paychecks as a reimbursement for the other 2 days of lunch.

## Health and Wellness

Nylas offers a monthly $100 stipend for health and wellness services, hosted and administered by Cherry. This balance rolls over during a 12 month period, allowing you to save and spend flexibly. 

Through this flexible program, we can help support what wellness means to you.


## Commuter Benefits

Tax-free commuter benefits allow you to reduce your monthly commuting expenses for transit, carpooling, bicycling, and work-related parking costs. You can sign up for this perk through your Gusto account. Please note that there is an annual maximum for this pre-tax benefit. The maximum dollar amount is found in [IRS Publication 15-B](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b/ar02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000193740).
