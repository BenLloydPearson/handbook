# Office Perks

## Meals

Foodies welcome! We offer lunch five days a week via Forkable, which will let you pick your own meal each day with a budget of $15, and dinner can be expensed for anyone who wants to work at the office past 6 p.m. Please help us use our resources wisely and cancel your lunch delivery if you're not going to be in the office.

Employees based out of the Nylas New York Office will receive a $15 a day stipend for lunch, applied directly to paychecks as a reimbursement.

## Gym Membership

Nylas offers reimbursements on gym memberships up to $70 a month (a maximum paid monthly that does not roll over). If you're in SF, you can join the Nylas account at Fitness SF (located a few blocks from the office) or Touchstone Climbing (several locations in the Bay Area, including Mission Cliffs and Dogpatch Boulders), or for any other gym we can set up a recurring reimbursement. Please contact Margaret for reimbursement or if you'd like help finding a gym.

## Rideshare Credit

Nylas offers a $100 rideshare credit each month for personal use. We are currently using Uber as we've found their business integration to be the most reliable. You'll receive an email at your work email when you start detailing how to connect your account. This credit is a maximum paid monthly and does not roll over.

## Commuter Benefits

Tax-free commuter benefits allow you to reduce your monthly commuting expenses for transit, carpooling, bicycling, and work-related parking costs. You can sign up for this perk through your WageWorks account. Please note that there is an annual maximum for this pre-tax benefit. The maximum dollar amount is found in [IRS Publication 15-B](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b/ar02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000193740).
