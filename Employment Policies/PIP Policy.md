| *What is a PIP?*                                                                         | A performance improvement plan is a formal document stating any recurring performance issues along with goals that an employee needs to achieve in order to regain good standing at the company (usually with a specific timeline to complete the plan).<br><br>If you’ve been struggling to meet your goals, a PIP is meant to give you concrete ways to turn your performance around. For most, simply knowing what you can do to improve is enough to make your way out of a slump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *I’m on a PIP — does that mean I’m getting fired?*                                       | Definitely not! A PIP demonstrates that your manager is dedicated enough to your improvement that they spent the time and thought to put together a formal plan on how you can best succeed.<br><br>However, you should remember that if you don’t meet the requirements in your PIP, there will be repercussions (which will be outlined in it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Got it! So, how can I make sure I successfully complete my PIP?*                        | Communication with your manager and/or HR is crucial. If you’re struggling to hit any of your goals or you’re confused about what’s expected of you, check in to see if your manager has any tips to help you become crystal clear on what you need to do. Doing this also shows that you’re proactive and taking this seriously.<br><br>Throughout your PIP, you will check in with your manager regularly on your progress. Checking in as often as you can will give you the ability to course correct any potential roadblocks early on and set yourself up for success.<br><br>Also, talk to some of your high-performing peers and ask them how they stay focused on their goals. Find someone who’s awesome at what you struggle with and pick their brain about how you can change your strategy.<br><br>And, most importantly, stay positive! You can do this—think about all you’re going to accomplish after you knock your PIP out of the park. Confidence in your own ability to improve will make it enormously easier to actually do it. |
| *I’ve successfully completed my plan! Is my manager going to hold this against me forever?* | Congratulations!

## The PIP Process
### Step 1: Determining if a PIP is appropriate

Performance for most employees is assessed during our bi-annual review process, with ongoing assessments from your manager throughout the year.

Following the review process, if an employee is showing signs of not meeting performance expectations, a PIP can be used when there is commitment from a manager to help the employee improve their performance, and there is a need for a more formalized process. PIP’s are used rarely and only when seen as absolutely necessary.

During the PIP creation process, HR will ask a manager specific questions and look at supporting evidence to determine if a PIP is appropriate:

- Is there an actual performance issue that can be substantiated?
    - Ask the manager to create a list of the performance deficiencies, including dates, specific data or detailed explanations, and any previous guidance given to the employee. 
    - Review the most recent performance appraisal to see if the issue is new or ongoing.
        
- Do you feel the manager is committed to helping the employee succeed?
    - HR will listen for whether the manager is concerned about the employee and wants to help, or if he or she is at the end of their rope and no longer able to manage the situation.
        
- Is it likely that the employee’s performance can be improved through a formal improvement plan?
    - Problems with sales goals, quality ratings, quantity objectives and similar issues may be well-suited to a structured plan that helps identify why the deficiencies occur.


### Step 2: Managers Develop a Draft Plan

Once the need for a PIP has been established, the manager(s) will create a draft of the plan for HR to review. An improvement plan will include:

- Information on what acceptable performance levels are and how the employee's current performance is deficient.
- Specific and measurable objectives that are achievable, relevant and time-bound (otherwise known as SMART goals). PIPs usually last 30, 60 or 90 days, depending on how long it would reasonably take to improve the specific issue or if there are business constraints to consider when looking at performance.
- Guidance on what management will do or provide to assist the employee in achieving these goals, such as additional resources, training or coaching.
- Details on how often the manager and employee will meet to discuss progress. This is often done once a week, but may vary depending on the circumstances or timeframe.
- Clearly stated consequences for not meeting the objectives of the plan. Options may include demotion, transfer to a different position, or termination.


### Step 3: HR Reviews the Plan

HR should review the plan with a focus on removing any bias against the employee. 

- Is the performance issue clearly stated and well-substantiated? 
- Are the objectives fair and equitable? 
    - For example, is a software engineer of a certain job level being given the same expectations of someone else at the same job level?
- Is the employee being given the proper tools and training needed to improve? 
- If it's a relatively new employee (after 3 months), was an adequate onboarding effort in place to help the employee become acclimated? 

The key to this step is to ensure that the plan is attainable and fair and not just a means to terminate an employee.


### Step 4: Implementing the Plan

It's time for the employee and manager to meet to discuss the plan and expectations. 

While not the most pleasant of meetings, it helps if the manager conveys their own commitment to the plan and to the employee's success. Employee feedback is encouraged to help identify areas of confusion and to help foster ownership. An employee may also propose changes on how they plan on achieving specific goals.

After fully discussing the plan, the manager may make modifications based on employee feedback. Once HR has reviewed any changes, the final plan should be signed by both manager and employee and forwarded to HR for approval.

If the employee is unable to commit to the PIP process at this point, the manager will need to determine whether termination, demotion, or another appropriate employment action should be taken.

#### Confidentiality:
A PIP is meant to be a private discussion between yourself and your manager. Your manager will not be releasing the details of your PIP to anyone other than key relevant stakeholders (such as HR), to maintain the respect and confidentiality of the situation. The intent of the PIP is not to demean you or change teammates' perception of your abilities. It is solely meant to give you a pathway for improvement. 

In turn, it is recommended that you also keep your PIP confidential outside of conversations with your manager and/or HR, as it is a personal and private matter. You’re still encouraged to generally discuss areas for improvement with your coworkers and teammates and see if there are areas for shared learnings. 

Legally, we cannot stop you from discussing that you're on a PIP or the details of your PIP with team members but make sure the decision to do so is carefully thought out and will help you complete the goals laid out in the PIP.


### Step 5: Monitoring Plan Progression

The manager should ensure all progress meetings are scheduled and occur on time. Depending on the PIP period, weekly or bi-weekly meetings outside of regular 1:1’s are encouraged to regularly monitor progress and clarify any questions or concerns.

Progress toward goals will be documented and discussed, seeking to identify why improvements have or have not been made. 

If gaps in training or required tools become apparent, those will be provided as soon as possible. Employees are encouraged to lead these meetings, to self-report on how they believe they are doing and what realizations they might have made, or what else they feel they need to succeed.

Successful progress made toward the goal will be recognized and encouraged, because we ultimately want to help people improve.


### Step 6: Plan Conclusion

When the employee has responded positively by meeting plan objectives, possibly before the expiration date of the plan, the manager will formally close the PIP, recognize the employee's success, and allow the employee to continue employment. 

While a positive occasion for the employee, the manager must be sure the employee understands that continued good performance is expected.

If an employee is unable to improve or if their performance worsens, the PIP will be closed, and a possible termination will be considered, depending on the specific circumstances.

When the employee is committed to improvement, but falls short of the objectives within the established timeline, there is potential for the PIP period to be extended to help the employee achieve their outlined goals.
