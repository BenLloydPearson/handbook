# Dog Policy

At Nylas, we support dog-friendly office days on Tuesdays and Thursdays assuming the dogs follow the guidelines below:

  1. Dogs must be vaccinated and flea-free.
  2. All dogs must be supervised or secured and cannot be left in Nylas facilities overnight or while the owner is not present. Dogs must stay where their owner intends them to be at all times.
  3. Manager approval is required before bringing a new dog to the office. Ensure your team is happy/comfortable with the dog.
  4. Any behavior which interferes with another employee's ability to work will be cause for a pet to be taken home (interference is in the eye of the beholder). Any complaint about a dog should be reported the dog owner’s manager (and the dog owner directly if you feel comfortable), and the dog will not be allowed back in the office. Aggressive behavior, such as growling, barking, chasing, or biting, is unacceptable and the pet will have to be taken home immediately.
  5. Owners are responsible for cleaning up after pets at all times. If a pet has more than one indoor "accident" they will be asked to go home.
  6. Employees are financially responsible for any damage or cleaning due to their dog’s actions, this includes damage from accidents, excessive pet hair and odor removal. Owners of the dog must maintain adequate liability insurance.  Nylas assumes no responsibility for any pet.
  7. Pet zones: Dogs are allowed only downstairs in the Nylas office in an effort to allow for uninterrupted work upstairs.
  8. No more than 2-3 dogs should be in the office at any time. It is up to the dog owners to communicate with each other about when they plan to bring their pets in. If three dogs are already in the office and a fourth arrives after, we will ask someone to take their dog home.
  9. If anyone with a dog allergy joins the team, dogs will no longer be permitted in the office.

This policy does not apply to “Assistive Animals.” An “Assistive Animal” is defined as any animal that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability or any individually trained animal otherwise necessary as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability.  If you have concerns with a dog but are unsure whether or not the dog is an “Assistive Animal,” please reach out to Human Resources first.
