# Nylas 7 Core Values

values we all hold in common and that guide us in our decisions and actions.

## Customer Obsession
- We create value for our customers because without our customers our company does not exist.
- We see our customers as humans, not corporations, and we treat them accordingly.
- We partner with our customers and use their feedback to guide our product and our business.

## Creativity
- We are creators. We are intrinsically motivated by the act of creation.
- We build things because we are builders at heart.
- And we see the opportunity to build as a reward in and of itself.

## Velocity
- We move with speed, purpose and direction.
- We look for points of leverage and efficiency at every turn so that we can move faster while preserving quality.
- We operate with a stretch goal mentality because we recognize that falling short of a lofty objective is better than over-delivering against a safe target.

## Output-Focused
- We value results over process.
- We take an active role in defining “how the work works” so that we can be effective and efficient.
- We care about work-life balance. We enforce limits between our work and home lives to make sure our personal needs are met.

## Diversity and Inclusion
- We welcome people of all backgrounds and we value different viewpoints.
- We celebrate diversity and work to minimize bias in our hiring and decision-making.
- We have zero-tolerance for discrimination and harassment and have explicit and documented processes for addressing any issues within the company.

## Open Communication
- We speak our truths, but we always do it with care for one another.
- We share information with one another whether it’s good or bad.
- We make it safe for others to communicate with us at all times and we are curious about others’ perspectives.

## Trust
- We trust one another to operate with the best interest of our customers and Nylas in mind.
- When faced with conflicting options, we are quick to disagree and commit.
- And when we get it wrong, we support one another as we work together to make it right.
