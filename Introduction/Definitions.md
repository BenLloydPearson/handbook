# Vision

Our ultimate "why." The reason we exist as a company.

Provides long-term (10+ years) direction and articulates the meaning behind
everything we do.

# Mission

Expands to the execution of the vision. The "how." Generally has a 3-5 years
horizon.

The mission will be revised as we near its achievement, or if we choose a
different path.

# Goals

The tactical measurements by which we can judge success and progress against
our mission and vision.

# Core Values

The values we all hold in common and that guide us in our decisions and actions.

Values evolve with time as the company grows and changes.
